    "# Bubble Sort in Python\n",
    "A Bubble sort is an easy algorithm among the various sorting algorithms. We learn it as a first sorting algorithm. It is easy to learn and highly intuitive. It can be easy to implement into the code, which is much beneficial for beginner software developers. But it is the worst algorithm for sorting the elements in every except because it checks every time the array is sorted or not.\n",

    "Concept of Bubble Sort\n",
    "The bubble sort uses a straightforward logic that works by repeating swapping the adjacent elements if they are not in the right order. It compares one pair at a time and swaps if the first element is greater than the second element; otherwise, move further to the next pair of elements for comparison."
